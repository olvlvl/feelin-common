RELEASE NOTE
------------

FEELIN HAS *ONLY* BEEN TESTED UNDER WINUAE AND OS4. USER WITH NO  GFX  CARDS
MAY  EXPERIENCE  TROUBLE  PARTICULIARLY WHEN USING PICTURES, SINCE REMAPPING
HAS BEEN DISABLED.

THE PREFERENCE EDITOR IS DISABLED IN THIS RELEASE. CHANGES  RELATED  TO  THE
NEW STYLES SUPPORT WHERE TOO MANY TO PUSH THE RELEASE DATE ANY FURTHER.


FIRST LAUNCH
------------

If it's your first time with Feelin, just launch the "setup" program.  It'll
take  care  of everything for you: you'll be able to choose a theme to start
with (more of them are available in "/resources/themes"); you'll be asked if
you want to modify your user-start to have Feelin ready at each startup...

Note that not a single file is copied to your system. A  couple  of  assigns
are all you need to enjoy Feelin.


HOW TO USE A DIFFERENT THEME ?
------------------------------

Currently, it's not possible to load themes from the preference  editor.  If
you want to use a theme from the "/resources/themes/" directory, you'll have
to type some letters in a shell.

Let's say you are in the "/resources/themes/" directory and you want to test
to "unity" theme, all you have to do is type the following command:

	copy unity.css env:feelin/global.css

If some Feelin applications are currently  running  they  will  be  updated.
Thus,  you  can  try  different themes to choose the one that best fits your
needs and most of all, your tastes. Once you have finished playing, you  can
save your configuration by typing:

	copy env:feelin/global.css envarc:feelin/global.css
