This folder contains sources to create the 'feelin'  linkable  library.  Its
main  purpose  is  to  provide  stub  functions  to variable arguments array
functions of feelin.library such as 'F_DoA()'. Its secondary purpose  it  to

feelin_68k.lib

This library is created by the 'makefile.68k.sasc' makefile.  Because  SAS/C
handles  Amiga  library  calls,  there  is  no  stubs in the library. Still,
support functions are available.
