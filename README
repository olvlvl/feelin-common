RELEASE NOTE
------------

THIS VERSION OF FEELIN HAS *ONLY* BEEN TESTED UNDER WINUAE. USER WITH NO GFX
CARDS  MAY  EXPERIENCE  TROUBLE  PARTICULIARLY  WHEN  USING  PICTURES, SINCE
REMAPPING HAS BEEN DISABLED.

THE PREFERENCE EDITOR IS STILL DISABLED IN THIS RELEASE.



COMPILING FEELIN
----------------

Feelin and its demos have been compiled for the 68040 proc. If your  machine
has  an  older  proc  or you are using a different system, you might want to
compile your own version of Feelin. Here is how to proceed :

1) in the /feelin/_make/ folder, override the  'makefile-header'  file  with
the   one   of   your   choice   e.g.   an  AOne  owner  will  override  the
'makefile-header' with the 'makefile-header.os4' file.

2) in the /feelin/sources/ folder, type 'make'. The shared library  and  the
classes  should  compile. You can delete all the generated objects by typing
'make clean'.

3) in the /feelin/ folder, type 'make'. The  'prefs'  and  'setup'  programs
should compile. You can delete the generated objects by typing 'make clean'.

4) in the /feelin/demos/ folder, type 'make'. The demos should compile.  You
can delete the generated objects by typing 'make clean'.



FIRST LAUNCH
------------

If it's your first time with Feelin, just launch the "setup" program at  the
root  of  Feelin's  folder. It'll take care of everything for you: you'll be
able to choose a theme  to  start  with  (more  of  them  are  available  in
"/resources/themes");  you'll be asked if you want to modify your user-start
to have Feelin ready at each startup...

Note that not a single file is copied to your system. A  couple  of  assigns
are all you need to enjoy Feelin.



HOW TO USE A DIFFERENT THEME ?
------------------------------

Currently, it's not possible to load themes from the preference  editor.  If
you want to use a theme from the "/resources/themes/" directory, you'll have
to type some letters in a shell.

Let's say you are in the "/resources/themes/" folder and you  want  to  test
the "unity" theme, all you have to do is type the following command:

	copy unity.css env:feelin/global.css

If some Feelin applications are currently  running  they  will  be  updated.
Thus,  you  can  try  different themes to choose the one that best fits your
needs and most of all, your tastes. Once you have finished playing, you  can
save your configuration by typing:

	copy env:feelin/global.css envarc:feelin/global.css
